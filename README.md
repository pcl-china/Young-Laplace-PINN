Capillary rise is a classic phenomenon, as depicted in Fig. 3. The diameter of the capillary is d, and the contact angle of the inner wall is θ. If the solid wall is hydrophilic, the liquid column will ascend along the inner surface of the capillary. Let H represent the height from the horizontal liquid surface to the three-phase contact line (TCL). Typically, the volume of liquid between the TCL and the lowest point of the curved meniscus is disregarded. Therefore, based on the principle of force balance, the height of the liquid column can be determined as follows
H=(4γ_lv cosθ)/ρgd
# Note
The PINN program is written based on the open source deep learning framework Pytorch version 1.10.2 in python.
